# Summary Exercise ‚Äì Using services

## Exercise Overview

You are required to implement an **exam system**.

The system should allow a user to answer several questions and calculate a **score** based on their responses.

### üñºÔ∏è UI Requirements

The screen should include:
- A list of questions
- A selected question view
- A score display

#### Question List:
- Highlight the currently selected question
- Indicate questions that were **answered correctly**
- Indicate questions that were **answered incorrectly**

### üß© Question Model

Each question should include the following fields:
- `id` ‚Äì unique identifier
- `questionText` ‚Äì the text of the question
- `correctAnswer` ‚Äì the correct answer value
- `options` ‚Äì an array of possible answers (`string[]`)
- `userAnswer?` ‚Äì the user's selected answer (initially empty)

### üìå Technical Requirements

- The list of questions must be fetched from a **Service**
- Any business logic not related to UI should be implemented in a **Service**
- The application should consist of **at least 3 Angular components**

### üí° Tips
- Structure your services with separation of concerns
- Use Angular's `@Injectable` to manage logic
- Use `@Input`/`@Output` for component communication if needed

### üß© Question Model

```ts
export interface Question {
  id: number;
  questionText: string;
  options: string[];
  correctAnswer: string;
  userAnswer?: string;
}
